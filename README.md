# Zymo_LandingPage
A Landing page developed for Zymo Research and can be reached here:
https://jedjaws.github.io/Zymo_LandingPage/
## Landing Page Description
This webpage was created to showcase my personal experience. It enables the user to press an "Inquire Now" button that scrolls the web page down to the form at the bottom. The user is then able to input their information in the required fields and submit their information. That information is then sent to my email notifying me that a form had been sent and of the information that was provided. After submitting the information, the user is then taken to "success.html", which automatically scrolls to the bottom of the page upon arrival. It then notifies the user that the form had been successfully submitted. "success.html" also informs the user that if another form were to be submitted they must press the "click" button to return to "index.html". This webpage is also responsive and can be used by different browsers and different viewing sizes.
### Tools Utilized
- Html, CSS, Javascript - to develop a proper webpage with style and minor functionality.
- formsubmit - allows the user to submit a form which then sends an email to me.

Example of a submitted form:
![form_submit](https://github.com/JedJaws/Zymo_LandingPage/assets/89428375/3b78a24c-278c-435d-ae16-b57ee24f579a)

### Tags Utilized
- div Tags - style and format different sections of the page.
- img tags - implement images that were included in the provided folder.
- h and p tags - used for titles, subtitles, and paragraphs
- ul an li tags - to format images in a horizontal list spaced equally, and to format the form at the bottom of the page.
- script tag - to provide javascript functionality for a button.
- button tag - for users to click for a response.
- form, input, and label tag - this creates a form for the user and labels different fields and provides a text box for input.
## Challenges
Some challenges faced were in regards to:
- Formatting - Centering items through padding and margin, paragraph formatting, and responsiveness.
- Javascript functionalities - further developing skills through javascript and implementing the functions in html.
- Working "Form" tag - "form" being a new tag for me personally, and being able to submit information through "formsubmit.co" which is also a new tool for me.
- Github Pages - first time utilizing github pages and figuring out how to have "formsubmit.co" work with it.
